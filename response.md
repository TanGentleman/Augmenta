Some people, known as tetrachromats, are believed to have an additional type of cone cell in their eyes that allows them to perceive a wider range of colors compared to the average human. Most humans have three types of cone cells, each sensitive to short (S), medium (M), and long (L) wavelengths of light. Tetrachromats are thought to have an additional type of cone cell sensitive to a shorter wavelength of light, often referred to as ultraviolet or blue-violet light. This ability is more common in certain animal species, such as some primates and birds, but it's rare in humans. The existence of tetrachromacy in humans is still a topic of ongoing research.

The production named "increment-sum" is designed to increment the value of the "sum" slot in the "goal" buffer by one, while also updating the "retrieval" buffer with the new sum value. This production is part of an ACT-R model that performs addition tasks.
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the production:
1. The production checks if the current goal (stored in the "goal" buffer) is an addition task (indicated by the "ISA" slot with the value "add").
2. The production then checks the current values of the "sum", "count", and "arg2" slots in the "goal" buffer. The "sum" slot represents the current sum of the addition problem, the "count" slot represents the number of times the "increment-sum" production has been fired, and the "arg2" slot represents the second argument of the addition problem.
3. The production checks if the value of the "arg2" slot is equal to the value of the "count" slot. This condition ensures that the production only fires when the current sum is equal to the second argument of the addition problem.
4. The production also checks the current value of the "number" slot in the "retrieval" buffer. This slot represents the current sum value being retrieved from declarative memory.
5. The production then retrieves the next sum value from declarative memory, which is stored in the "next" slot of the "retrieval" buffer. This value is assigned to the "newsum" variable.
6. Once the conditions are met, the production fires and performs the following actions:
   a. It updates the "sum" slot in the "goal" buffer with the new sum value (stored in the "newsum" variable).
   b. It updates the "number" slot in the "retrieval" buffer with the current count value (stored in the "count" slot of the "goal" buffer).
By firing this production, the model is able to increment the sum value by one and update the retrieval buffer with the new sum value. This process continues until the sum value is equal to the second argument of the addition problem, at which point the "terminate-addition" production is fired to stop the model.
